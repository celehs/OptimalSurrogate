**Model Free Approach to Quantifying the Proportion of Treatment Effect Explained by a Surrogate Marker** 

by Xuan Wang, Layla Parast, Lu Tian, and Tianxi Cai. 

For illustration, two data examples are provided

- `data/dataexample.RData` with **continuous** surrogate marker

- `data/dataexample_d.RData` with **discrete** surrogate marker

Some code optimization has been performed to make the R programs run faster (see `code-ming`). An R package and documentation are currently under development and will be released here soon.
