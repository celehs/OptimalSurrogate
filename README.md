**Model Free Approach to Quantifying the Proportion of Treatment Effect Explained by a Surrogate Marker** 

by Xuan Wang, Layla Parast, Lu Tian, and Tianxi Cai. 

**NOTE**: This paper has been submitted to _Biometrika_ and is currently under revision.

Two data examples are provided:

- `data/dataexample.RData` with **continuous** surrogate marker

- `data/dataexample_d.RData` with **discrete** surrogate marker

Some code optimization has been performed to make the R programs run faster. 

- **continuous** example: 15.934 seconds (`dataexample-ming.Rout`) vs. 43.576 seconds (`dataexample-xuan.Rout`)

- **discrete** example: 10.220 seconds (`dataexample_d-ming.Rout`) vs. 29.165 seconds (`dataexample_d-xuan.Rout`)

An R package and a documentation website are still under development and will be released here soon.
